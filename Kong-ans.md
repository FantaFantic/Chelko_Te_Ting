1. a Fire-extinguisher

Chelko, a Czech master during the era 199?-xxxx, received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.

Chelko started to fill the Fire-extinguisher . He filled the Fire-extinguisher full, and then kept on filling.

The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. "It is overfull. No more will go in!"

"Like this Fire-extinguisher," Chelko said, "you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your Fire-extinguisher?"
"How can you extinguish the fire within, if you keep your extinguisher full?"
